# Cryptocurrencies_Machine_Learning_Unsupervised
For this project, I am performing unsupervised machine learning on cryptocurrency data in order to discover patterns and groups in data. The purpose of this analysis is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped in order to create a classification system for potential new investments into various cryptocurrencies.

Data:
